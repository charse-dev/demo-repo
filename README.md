# Git and Github for Beginners

## What is Git?
A: Free and open source version control system.

## What is Version Control?
A: way to track code changes. We save an initial version of our code into Git. When we update code, we can save it into Git again and again. Throughout time as our code continues to evolve, we can look back at all of the changes we have made over time.
This helps us to see and understand what we did when, track down bugs, or go back to previous versions of our code.

## Terms:
directory -> Folder
Terminal or Command Line -> Interface for Text Commands
CLI -> Command Line Interface
cd -> change directory
Code Editor -> Word Processor for Writing Code
Repository -> Project, or the folder/place where your project is kept
Github -> A website to host your repositories online

## Git Commands:
clone -> Bring a repository that is hosted somewhere like Github into a folder on your local machine.
add -> Track your files and changes in Git. (update, create, delete..)
commit -> Save your files in Git.
push -> Upload Git commits to a remote repository, like Github
pull -> Download changes from remote repository to your local machine, the opposite of ‘push’
